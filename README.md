# epimodel-project
Code that simulated covid spread at a small university with mulitple levels of testing 

I used the epimodel package to simulate multiple different testing rates and measure their effect on peak infection number to determine the rate needed to prevent a peak of 150.

The picture included in the results of the simulations

The code needs a lot of cleanning because this was just for a school project and once I had the results graph I basically stopped coding and moved straight to making the presentation.
